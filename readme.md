abstractman
===========
heavy metaclass use from [backbone4000](https://github.com/leshy/backbone4000)

- graph objects (directed/bidirectional, graph nodes belonging to multiple graph networks (see "plugs" in [graph.ls](https://github.com/leshy/abstractman/blob/master/graph.ls)) )
- finite state machines (on top of graph objects)
 
for now, see [tests](https://github.com/leshy/abstractman/blob/master/tests.ls) for documentation.
    
can display itself in ubigraph via [nodejs-ubigraph](https://github.com/leshy/nodejs-ubigraph)
